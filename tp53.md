"Mutation in the TP53 gene is almost the defining feature of a lethal cancer... People born with one faulty version of TP53 out of the two they inherit, have a ninety-five percent chance of getting cancer, and usually at an early stage."

A ðŸ§µ on TP53, the crucial cancer warrior:

TP53 is a gene found on chromosome 17 in humans. It encodes (= has the recipe for making) a protein called "Tumor Protein 53" or "Guardian of the Genome".

The TP53 protein, like many others, is not produced in constant quantities inside the cell all the time.

Certain 'stressful' conditions - such as low oxygen, exposure to radiation, toxic chemicals, UV from sunlight - can increase the production of TP53 in the cell.

These stresses are notorious for causing damage to DNA in the cell nucleus.

Cells divide to create copies of themselves (one cell will divide into two identical copies of itself). If damaged DNA is passed on the child cells from the parent cell, the number of cells with damaged DNA will rise exponentially (doubling) with each cell division. 4/n

The effects of damaged DNA can range from insignificant to fatal, which is why various mechanisms are built into human biology to prevent cells from having and multiplying damaged DNA.

The TP53 protein is part of one such important mechanism. 5/n

Whenever damage to DNA is detected, the production of TP53 protein in the cell increases. If the damage can be fixed, TP53 stops cell growth until repairs are done.

If the damage cannot be repaired, TP53 can cause the cell to kill itself (known as 'apoptosis' or cell death). 6/n
