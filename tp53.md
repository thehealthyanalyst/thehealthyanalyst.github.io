### TP53 - the crucial cancer warrior

"Mutation in the TP53 gene is almost the defining feature of a lethal cancer... People born with one faulty version of TP53 out of the two they inherit, have a ninety-five percent chance of getting cancer, and usually at an early stage."

A ðŸ§µ on TP53, the crucial cancer warrior:

TP53 is a gene found on chromosome 17 in humans. It encodes (=has the recipe for making) a protein called 'Tumor Protein 53' or 'Guardian of the Genome'.

The TP53 protein, like many others, is not present in constant quantities inside the cell all the time. 2/n

Certain 'stressful' conditions - such as low oxygen, exposure to radiation, toxic chemicals, UV from sunlight - can increase the production of TP53 in the cell. These stresses are notorious for causing damage to DNA in the cell nucleus. 3/n

Cells divide to create copies of themselves (one cell will divide into two identical copies of itself). If damaged DNA is passed to the child cells from the parent cell, the number of cells with damaged DNA will rise exponentially (doubling) with each cell division. 4/n

The effects of damaged DNA can range from insignificant to fatal, which is why various mechanisms are built into human biology to prevent cells from having and multiplying damaged DNA.

The TP53 protein is part of one such important mechanism. 5/n

Whenever damage to DNA is detected, the amount of active TP53 protein in the cell increases. If the damage can be fixed, TP53 stops cell growth until repairs are done. If the damage cannot be fixed, TP53 can cause the cell to kill itself (known as 'apoptosis' or cell death). 6/n

When DNA is damaged or mutated (changed from its original form), TP53 will prevent cell division by interfering with the function of genes required for cell division.

Cancers result from uncontrolled multiplication of cells with mutated DNA. 7/n

In cancer, cells with previously normal function and behaviour go into uncontrolled multiplication mode due to changes (mutations) in the DNA. They begin using the body's resources (energy, oxygen supply, nutrients) at the expense of other cells and tissues. 8/n

In early stage cancer, there are gene mutations that allow rapid cell division and multiplication, however, TP53 is often unchanged. In such cases, the cell can be exposed to stress (radiation or chemicals) that will cause TP53 to become active and cause cell death. 9/n

Chemotherapy and radiation therapy rely on this to treat cancer. Exposure to chemicals/radiation causes activation of TP53, which causes the DNA mutations to either be fixed or induce the mutant cells to kill themselves. 10/n

As cancer progresses, mutations accumulate in the cells - think of this as making copies of a text by writing by hand. With every round of copying, the mistakes are likely to compound. Even if you have a proofreading mechanism in place, it'll be hard to catch all errors. 11/n

Cancer cells grow and multiply faster than normal, increasing the probability for unchecked errors in DNA replication. And this growth keeps accelerating - the more cells there are, more copies are created and greater the possibility for errors. 12/n

A mutation in the TP53 gene can cause a less useful TP53 protein to be produced - it may be unable to stop a cell with mutated DNA from dividing. TP53 serves as a crucial last barrier of sorts - as long as it produces a normal TP53 protein, cancer treatment may be fruitful. 13/n

Once TP53 is mutated, a number of chemo and radiation therapy treatments may be ineffective. This is often the case in late stage cancers - the mutated cells are numerous and even if a few have the TP53 mutation, it'll be hard to stop them from multiplying unchecked. 14/n

Like all genes (except those on the X and Y chromosomes), there are two copies of the TP53 gene in each cell - one on each chromosome of the 17th pair. However, even if one of the copies has a mutation that makes the TP53 protein ineffective, the cell can multiply unchecked. 15/n

And that is why TP53 is a "tumor suppressor" and a crucial warrior against cancer.
