A üßµ on why you should care about blood glucose levels:

So what's a biomarker?

‚Äúa characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.‚Äù

Notes:
- The microvascular complications (retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy) of diabe- tes are closely associated with the degree and duration of hyperglycemia
- Diagnostic cut points for diabetes, in other words, fasting plasma glucose of 7.0 mmol/l and 2-h postoral glucose load (75 g) plasma glucose of 11.1 mmol/l (Box 1), are associated with a risk of microvascular complications, specifically retinopathy
- Hemoglobin (Hb)A1c provides an indication of chronic glycemia over the preceding 1‚Äì3 months rather than at a single point in time advantages of HbA1c compared with fasting plasma glucose and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), include greater convenience (no requirement for fasting), greater pre- analytical stability and less variability arising from acute stress and illness. These advantages may be offset by the lower sensitivity of HbA1C at the designated cut point, higher cost, limited availability in parts of the developing world, and imperfect correlations between HbA1C and average glucose levels in some individuals.
-  In insulin-requiring patients with diabetes SMBG (self monitored blood glucose) helps guide patients and healthcare providers adjust insulin doses on a daily basis. However, there is no consensus on frequency and timing of SMBG. Current ADA rec- ommendations are that patients should use SMBG and HbA1c levels to assess glycemic control.
-  Continuous Glucose monitoring: A membrane-clad, needle-shaped enzyme electrode is inserted through the skin into the subcutaneous fatty tissue to access interstitial fluid. CGM measures glucose changes in the interstitial fluid in the abdominal sub- cutaneous tissue and not directly in the blood.  CGM recordings have provided evidence that diurnal glu- cose patterns may considerably differ in individual patients, even at identical HbA1c levels. Gradients between interstitial and plasma glucose concentrations may vary by 20 and 110%.
-  In clinical trials, CGM has been associated with reduction of glucose variability, time spent in hypogly- cemia or hyperglycemia and improved HbA1c levels 
-  Expert panels of diabetes specialists have identified time in glucose range as one of the key metrics for guiding diabetes treatment 
-  value of the technology for determining overnight blood glucose profiles and quantifying post-prandial hyperglycaemia 
-  Basic glucose outcome measures include: time spent in desired ranges; time in hypoglycemia; time in hyperglycemia; measures of CGM glucose variability (see above); safety mea- sures such as severe hypoglycemia and diabetic keto- acidosis
-  The consensus report acknowledged that HbA1c remains the best measure of long-term glyce- mic control but highlighted the capacity of CGM for identifying hypoglycemic events
